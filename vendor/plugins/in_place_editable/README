InPlaceEditable
===============

When you use the in_place_editing plugin by David Heinemeier Hansson, it has some minor problems.
This plugin helps you with this.

1.  It rejects entered data when it makes the object invalid.
2.  When the value is blank, it adds dash '-' to keep it clickable.

It does this by making proxies for the attributes in your model.
These attributes start with 'in_place_' followed by the attribute name.

Don't forget to install the in_place_editing plugin!


Example
=======

  # In your model:
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    in_place_editable_columns :name, :email
  end
  
  # In your controller:
  class UsersController < ApplicationController
    in_place_edit_for :user, :in_place_name
    in_place_edit_for :user, :in_place_email
  end

  # In your view:
  <%= in_place_editor_field :user, :in_place_name %>
  <%= in_place_editor_field :user, :in_place_email %>
